# 3D Shape Reconstruction with 3D-R2N2 and GRU

This project implements a 3D Recurrent Reconstruction Neural Network (3D-R2N2) using PyTorch to reconstruct 3D voxelized shapes from single-view 2D images. The architecture is adapted from the original 3D-R2N2 paper, with modifications to reduce model complexity while maintaining reconstruction capability.

## Overview

- **Task**: 3D shape reconstruction from single-view 2D images  
- **Dataset**: [ShapeNetCore](https://shapenet.org/) (subset of 25,000 samples used)  
- **Architecture**: Encoder → GRU → Decoder  
- **Output**: 3D voxel grids (32×32×32)  
- **ML Method**: Supervised Learning  
- **Framework**: PyTorch

## Features

- Replaced LSTM with GRU for efficiency  
- Simplified decoder with single 3D convolution layer  
- Used Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCELoss)  
- Optimized with Adam, learning rate scheduler, and gradient clipping  
- Visualized outputs using TensorBoard and 3D scatter plots  
- Evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU)

## Results

| Metric          | Value  |
|-----------------|--------|
| Training Loss   | 0.178  |
| Validation Loss | 0.204  |
| IoU Score       | 0.107  |

*Note: The simplified model trades off detail for reduced computational cost. Future improvements include training on the full dataset and testing alternative RNN layers.*
